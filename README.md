# Text Typer Program
This program is a simple text-typing application that allows the user to input text and have it typed out automatically. It uses the Python `pyautogui` library to simulate typing and the Tkinter library to create a GUI. 

## Functionality
The program starts with a GUI that prompts the user to input the text they want to be typed out, as well as the typing speed and startup delay. The user can adjust the typing speed and startup delay using two sliders. 

Once the user has inputted their text and settings, they can click the "Start" button to begin the typing process. The program will automatically type out the text, with a delay specified by the startup delay, and a speed specified by the typing speed. 

The user can also press the "0" key during the typing process to skip the startup delay and immediately begin typing. 

Finally, the user can press the "Exit" button to close the program. 

## Usage
To use this program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can run the program by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory containing the program file, and running the command `python ****`. 

You will then be prompted with a GUI where you can input the text you want to be typed out, as well as adjust the typing speed and startup delay using the sliders. Once you have adjusted your settings, click the "Start" button to begin the typing process. You can press the "0" key during the typing process to skip the startup delay and immediately begin typing. 

Press the "Exit" button to close the program. 

Note: It is important to not switch windows or interfere with the typing process during execution.
